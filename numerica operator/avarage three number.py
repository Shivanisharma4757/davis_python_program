# Program to calculate the average of three numbers

# Take three numbers as input from the user
num1 = float(input("Enter the first number: "))
num2 = float(input("Enter the second number: "))
num3 = float(input("Enter the third number: "))

# Calculate the sum of the three numbers
total = num1 + num2 + num3

# Calculate the average by dividing the sum by 3
average = total / 3

# Display the average

print("The average of the three numbers is:", average)


# output
# Enter the first number: 5
# Enter the second number: 10
# Enter the third number: 15
